Welcome to this case study demonstrating how strategic Quality Engineering delivers tangible, impactful results. In a previous role at **Celonis**, my team and I embarked on a journey to transform our testing landscape. Our aim was a dramatic improvement in product stability and customer satisfaction, which we achieved by elevating regression coverage to **over 90%** and securing an impressive **80% reduction in customer-reported issues**.

### Context & My Goal

When this initiative began, our regression coverage was minimal (0-10%), posing a significant risk of introducing defects that directly impacted users. Customers frequently encountered issues, straining support and eroding confidence. My objective was to implement a robust, scalable, and proactive approach to quality to resolve these issues and ensure product stability.

### My Contribution & Approach

My strategy focused on smart, comprehensive automation:

1.  **Test Suite Development:** Systematically identified critical user flows and high-risk areas to build a comprehensive suite of automated regression tests. Collaborated closely with product and development teams to align coverage with business priorities.
2.  **Framework & Integration:** Leveraged robust automation frameworks (e.g., Selenium, Playwright, Cypress with C#/Typescript) to ensure stable, maintainable tests. Integrated these seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines for rapid feedback loops.
3.  **Metrics-Driven Improvement:** Established clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for test coverage, defect leakage, and automation stability. This data-driven approach guided our efforts and decision-making.
4.  **Cross-Functional Ownership:** Fostered a culture where quality was a shared responsibility, promoting collaboration among developers, QEs, and Product Owners to proactively address issues.

### Measurable Impact & Results

Within less than two years, the transformation was evident and measurable:

* **Regression Coverage:** Increased from 0-10% to **over 90%**, providing unprecedented confidence in releases.
* **Customer Issues:** Achieved an **80% reduction** in customer-reported issues, directly leading to higher user satisfaction and fewer disruptions for support.
* **Accelerated Delivery:** Reliable automated checks led to faster, more predictable release cycles, enabling more frequent value delivery.

### Technologies & Methodologies Utilized

* **Automation Frameworks:** Selenium, Playwright, Cypress (if applicable)
* **Languages:** C#, Typescript
* **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps (or specific tools used)
* **Metrics:** Custom Dashboards, Jira (for defect tracking and KPIs)
* **Methodologies:** Agile, Data-Driven Quality Management, Continuous Testing

### **Key Learnings & Future Outlook**

This journey reinforced several core beliefs: quality is an investment that yields dividends in stability and user satisfaction; strategic automation is a game-changer; and data empowers informed decisions. I am committed to applying these principles to continue driving significant business outcomes through Quality Engineering.
