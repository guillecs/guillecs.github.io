		<p>Welcome to this overview of my experience in <strong>building and leading high-performing Quality Engineering teams</strong>. My approach extends beyond technical execution, deeply rooted in nurturing and empowering teams to achieve excellence and foster a dynamic, innovative work environment.</p>

<h3 id="context--my-goal">Context &amp; My Goal</h3>

<p>In rapidly evolving software landscapes, the challenge lies in cultivating QE teams that are not just technically proficient but also highly collaborative, adaptable, and self-improving. My goal was to ensure consistent quality deliverables while promoting individual growth, team cohesion, and a shared passion for quality.</p>

  <li><strong>Fostering Innovation &amp; Ownership:</strong> I encouraged team members to explore new tools and techniques, empowering them to take ownership of quality initiatives and contribute to process enhancements.</li>
  <li><strong>Promoting Cross-Functional Collaboration:</strong> I facilitated effective communication and collaboration between QE teams, Product Owners, and Engineering Managers, ensuring quality was a shared responsibility across the SDLC.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Management &amp; Feedback:</strong> I conducted regular performance reviews, providing constructive feedback and recognition to ensure team members felt valued and motivated.</li>
</ol>
