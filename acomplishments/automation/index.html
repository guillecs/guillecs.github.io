			<h1>Quantifiable Impact in Regression Coverage & Issue Reduction</h1>
		</header>
		
		<p>Welcome to this case study demonstrating how strategic Quality Engineering delivers tangible, impactful results. In a previous role at <strong>Celonis</strong>, my team and I embarked on a journey to transform our testing landscape. Our aim was a dramatic improvement in product stability and customer satisfaction, which we achieved by elevating regression coverage to <strong>over 90%</strong> and securing an impressive <strong>80% reduction in customer-reported issues</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="context--my-goal">Context &amp; My Goal</h3>

<p>When this initiative began, our regression coverage was minimal (0-10%), posing a significant risk of introducing defects that directly impacted users. Customers frequently encountered issues, straining support and eroding confidence. My objective was to implement a robust, scalable, and proactive approach to quality to resolve these issues and ensure product stability.</p>

<h3 id="my-contribution--approach">My Contribution &amp; Approach</h3>

<p>My strategy focused on smart, comprehensive automation:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Test Suite Development:</strong> Systematically identified critical user flows and high-risk areas to build a comprehensive suite of automated regression tests. Collaborated closely with product and development teams to align coverage with business priorities.</li>
  <li><strong>Framework &amp; Integration:</strong> Leveraged robust automation frameworks (e.g., Selenium, Playwright, Cypress with C#/Typescript) to ensure stable, maintainable tests. Integrated these seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines for rapid feedback loops.</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics-Driven Improvement:</strong> Established clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for test coverage, defect leakage, and automation stability. This data-driven approach guided our efforts and decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-Functional Ownership:</strong> Fostered a culture where quality was a shared responsibility, promoting collaboration among developers, QEs, and Product Owners to proactively address issues.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="measurable-impact--results">Measurable Impact &amp; Results</h3>

<p>Within less than two years, the transformation was evident and measurable:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regression Coverage:</strong> Increased from 0-10% to <strong>over 90%</strong>, providing unprecedented confidence in releases.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Issues:</strong> Achieved an <strong>80% reduction</strong> in customer-reported issues, directly leading to higher user satisfaction and fewer disruptions for support.</li>
  <li><strong>Accelerated Delivery:</strong> Reliable automated checks led to faster, more predictable release cycles, enabling more frequent value delivery.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technologies--methodologies-utilized">Technologies &amp; Methodologies Utilized</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Automation Frameworks:</strong> Selenium, Playwright, Cypress (if applicable)</li>
  <li><strong>Languages:</strong> C#, Typescript</li>
  <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps (or specific tools used)</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Custom Dashboards, Jira (for defect tracking and KPIs)</li>
  <li><strong>Methodologies:</strong> Agile, Data-Driven Quality Management, Continuous Testing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-learnings--future-outlook"><strong>Key Learnings &amp; Future Outlook</strong></h3>

<p>This journey reinforced several core beliefs: quality is an investment that yields dividends in stability and user satisfaction; strategic automation is a game-changer; and data empowers informed decisions. I am committed to applying these principles to continue driving significant business outcomes through Quality Engineering.</p>
